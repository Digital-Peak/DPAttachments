### Introduction
The DPAttachments Joomla project uses its own translation service to maintain all available language translations. Its an easy to use online tool based on Weblate, which can be used to update translations easily and without any in-depth or technical knowledge. Alternatively, it allows you to download the current translation and update it with your favorite tool. It also allows anyone to download the most current version of any translated file.

Having your language in the Digital Peak translation service is the only way to get it into DPAttachments.

### Language files
Every extension shipped with the DPAttachments package has a language folder where the translations/language files are located. For example, if you want to translate the DPAttachments frontend into your language, copy the file /components/com_dpattachments/language/en-GB/com_dpattachments.ini to /components/com_dpattachments/language/it-IT/com_dpattachments.ini and translate the English strings inside the double quotes.

### Language overrides
The strings in DPAttachments are loaded through the Joomla language manager. Joomla offers to overwrite these strings in the language manager of Joomla itself. More information can be found [here](https://docs.joomla.org/J3.x:Language_Overrides_in_Joomla).

Note: Most of the language strings of DPAttachments are in the administration part. So you need to make them for the location Administrator and do tick for both locations.

You can register at [translate.digital-peak.com](https://translate.digital-peak.com/). Please use your username you are using on joomla.digital-peak.com!

### Enable notifications
To get notifications when new components or strings are added/updated, go to your [profile](https://translate.digital-peak.com/accounts/profile/#notifications) and set all option in the "Translation notifications" panel to "instant notification". This is very important to be able to maintain the extension you want.
